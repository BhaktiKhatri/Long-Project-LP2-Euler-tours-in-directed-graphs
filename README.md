# Long-Project-LP2-Euler-tours-in-directed-graphs
A directed graph is called Eulerian if it is strongly connected, and the number of incoming edges at each node is equal to the number of outgoing edges from it. It is known that such a graph aways has a tour (a cycle that may not be simple) that goes through every edge of the graph exactly once. Such a tour (sometimes called a circuit) is called an Euler tour. In this project, write code that finds an Euler tour in a given graph using the algorithm described in class
